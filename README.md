## Welcome to Sr3qt's Advent of Code proposed solutions

These are my proposed solution in C++ using CMake.
The source code for each day can be found inside the corresponding folder. Some days are not solved in C++, notably day 2 which is solved in Python and day 6 which was attempted to solve by hand.

When running the excecutable program it expects a day argument: -d [day].

It also expects the puzzle input is in a "data.txt" file in the folder of day to be solved. You will have to copy the puzzle inputs into such a file manually. Because everyones input is personalized you will have to get your own input from the [AoC website](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

Lastly make sure there are no blank lines at the end of "data.txt" as it may cause errors.
