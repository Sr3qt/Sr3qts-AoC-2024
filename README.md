The source code for each day can be found in its own folder.
When running the excecutable it expects a day argument: -d [day].
It also expects the puzzle input is in a "data.txt" file in the folder of day to be solved. You will have to copy the puzzle inputs into such a file manually. Because everyones input is personalized you will have to get your own input from the [AoC website](https://adventofcode.com/2024). Lastly blank lines at the end of the file can cause errors, remove them if they cause you trouble.
